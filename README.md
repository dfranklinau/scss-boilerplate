# SCSS boilerplate

A boilerplate (written in SCSS) to serve as a scalable and maintainable CSS
foundation. It uses stylelint and `stylelint-order` to maintain consistency.

The included `.stylelintrc` file is heavily opinionated but it can be swapped
with your own configuration (bearing in mind the version of stylelint will
affect what options are available to configure).

It is based on the [ITCSS
methodology](https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss) by
[Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com).





## Installation

Using the boilerplate requires no initial set up, but to use stylelint:

```
npm install
```

`stylelint` can be manually run via `npx`:

```
npx stylelint
```
